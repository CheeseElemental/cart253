## Description

Based on functionality taught to me by Mathiled, this ended up being an interesting exercise in cooridination.  Try to keep the mouse (the smallest circle) lined up with the other two cirlces as they move across the screen.  

## Credits

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and map functionality

## Attribution

Special thanks to Kiana for teaching me how to map function, Mathilde for the concept, and Professor Barr for basically the rest of the code.
